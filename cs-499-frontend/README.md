## Running this Project Locally

*Note the following commands assume a Unix-based enviornment. If you are on windows, you may need to use something such as Windows Subsystem for Linux (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).*

```sh
$ git clone <repo-name>
$ cd <repo-name>
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

After executing these commands, your express backend and React frontend should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). 

## Testing with Continuous Integration

**Note that you are not required to test your project with Jest for HW3, however, we have enabled this functionality in case you would like to use it. If you would like to remove the tests, you can remove the `.github` directory from the repo.**

Currently, this repo is set up to run the Jest tests in the `App.test.js` file upon each commit to the `main` branch of the repository. If any of the tests fail, the CI process will fail and this will be indicated with red "X" on the main page of your repo, and GitHub will likely also send you a notification email that your automated tests have failed.

Currently, the tests are configured to run by getting deployed to a remote virtual server with an Ubuntu operating system, where the `npm install` and `npm test` commands are executed.

Note that we have included the [`jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom/) library for your tests. This allows you to check DOM elements in your tests.

You can find the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) script for this CI job [here](.github/workflows/ci.yml) if you want to learn more.
